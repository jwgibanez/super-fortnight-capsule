- admin/pass1234
- user1/pass1234
- user2/pass1234

Enter any one of the above credentials to access the user list and details pages.

## Implementation

- Written in Kotlin
- One activity with three fragments: login, user list, user detials fragment
- Fragment navigation via Navigation Controller
- Implemented MVVM architecture via View Binding, Data Binding, ViewModels & LiveData
- Dependency injection via Hilt
- Reactive programming via RxJava
- Material design principles
- Networking layer via Retrofit & OkHttp

## Building locally

Clone the repository via
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwgibanez/super-fortnight-capsule.git
```

Create file `local.properties` on root folder
```
MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Build the release apk
```
$ ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Testing

The architecture is consiously designed so that all layers are testable as much as possible.

Automated test have been implemented covering all layers in the MVVM architecture:
- View: UITest (HomeActivity)
- ViewModel: LoginViewModelTest (LoginViewModel)
- Model: AppDatabaseTest (AppDatabase), LoginRepositoryTest (LoginRepository), UserServiceTest (UserService) etc.

To run all test, attach device to adb and run
```
$ ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## CI/CD

On every commit to `main`, automated build is done by Github Actions to check the app is building successfully.
